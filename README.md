#### Description
Do quick lookups of Stardew Valley character gift reactions!

This script lets you do quick comparisons of items to character gifts. I made this to practice web scraping and parsing, and because Stardew Valley is a great game. Made with Python and Beautiful Soup

#### How to use

Install beautifulsoup4 and requests

`> pip install requests`
`> pip install beautifulsoup4`

Pick an item and a character from Stardew Valley, and run:

`python scrape.py <Character> <Item>`

example `python scrape.py Leah Wine`

`>Leah Loves Wine`

Amazing.
